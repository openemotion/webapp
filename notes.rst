Notes
=====

* I'm storing the name of the currently logged in user in the cookies. Is it safe?
* Need to create unit tests
* Need to replace error pages (make them nice and friendly and in Hebrew)
* Maybe we need to use Captcha on registration to prevent bots from registering
* Consider using http://www.jformer.com/ for form validation.
* In production environment, we should use jquery from Google CDN.
