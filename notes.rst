* I'm storing the name of the currently logged in user in the cookies. Is it safe?
* Need to sanitize the data in the forms
* Need to create unit tests
* We need to handle time-zones to correctly display the time on the messages
  (or we could just display relative time - 7 minutes ago, etc.)
* Need to replace error pages (make them nice and friendly)
* Maybe we need to use Captcha on registration to prevent bots from registering
